# Candidate Details Page – Assignment

## Project Overview
This project is a **single-page Vue.js application** developed as part of an assignment.  
The goal was to implement a **Candidate Details Page** based on the provided wireframe.  

The application demonstrates:
- UI/UX implementation with **HTML, SCSS, and Vue 3**
- State management with **Pinia**
- Functionality to **edit candidate details** and update them dynamically
- Use of **Composition API** and **mocked API calls**
- Clean and organized code following best practices

## Learning Journey
Before starting this assignment, I was a **complete beginner** in Vue.js.  
Here’s how I prepared and executed the project:

1. **Understanding Vue Basics**  
   - Asked ChatGPT for an overview of Vue.js and its ecosystem.  
   - Learned key concepts like components, props, data binding, event handling, and lifecycle hooks.

2. **Self-Learning**  
   - Followed couple of **YouTube tutorials** to progress from beginner to moderate-level understanding.  
   - Practiced using the **Composition API** and managing state with **Pinia**.

3. **Analyzing the Assignment**  
   - Carefully studied the wireframe and requirements.  
   - Broke down the tasks into UI building, state management, mocked API integration, and edit functionality.

## Approach
- **UI/UX Development**
  - Built responsive layouts matching the provided wireframe.  
  - Used **boxicons** for icons as suggested.  

- **Front-end Development**
  - Implemented candidate details display and an **Edit details** feature.  
  - Clicking the edit icon opens a form, and updates reflect on the page using **Pinia** state management.  
  - Used mocked API responses to simulate fetching candidate data.  

- **Code Quality**
  - Organized components for clarity and reusability.  
  - Followed best practices in Vue 3 with **Composition API + composables**.  
  - Verified functionality through manual testing and debugging.

## Challenges Faced
- **Learning Curve:** As a beginner, understanding Vue’s reactivity and component-based architecture required effort.  
- **Pinia State Management:** Initially struggled to connect store updates with components but resolved it after exploring documentation and examples.  
- **Mock API Integration:** Setting up mocked data and wiring it into state management was new and required extra practice.  

---

## Solutions Implemented
- Tackled the Vue learning curve by dividing tasks into smaller parts and testing frequently.  
- Used **Pinia** effectively to ensure state updates reflect immediately in the UI.  
- Created **reusable components** (buttons, form inputs, cards) for consistency.  
- Integrated mocked API calls to simulate real-world data fetching.  

---

## Tech Stack
- **Vue 3** (Composition API)  
- **Pinia** for state management  
- **TypeScript**  
- **HTML + SCSS**  
- **Boxicons** for icons  
- **Mocked API** (simulated GET call for candidate details)

## Conclusion
This project was a significant learning experience as I started as a **complete beginner in Vue.js** and gradually built confidence through research, tutorials, and experimentation.  
The final output reflects consistent effort, problem-solving, and practical application of Vue 3 fundamentals.
